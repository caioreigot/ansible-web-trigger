# Ansible Web Trigger

A simple interface where you can give commands to ansible through the execution of scripts in the shell by the PHP server, which returns the result to the web client.

## Requirements to run the project locally:
- Install Ansible
- Install PHP
- Go to the web folder and type ```npm install``` in your terminal
- You will need two terminals, one to run the ```server.php``` contained in the backend folder with the command ```php server.php``` and the other to run the front end with the command ```npm run dev``` in the web folder
- Once the server is running, you can go to the page and click the run button.
